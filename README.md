## Pokédex (Project requirement at CareerFoundry)

This is a Javascript app, where I use an external API to get 150 pokémons from the list. With this link you can go directly to the site: https://https://thekoypond.github.io/simple-js-app/ . Or you can start 'index.html', if you have the files locally. 

### How to use the site:

You can click on the buttons to see the pomémon's height and an image of it. The modal window can be closed by clicking on the 'Close' button, clicking outside the  window or pressing 'Escape'. 

### Used resources:

Syntaxes: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Framework: Bootstrap

Source: https://pokeapi.co/ , https://getbootstrap.com/
